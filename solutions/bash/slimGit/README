Hey there.

There's two possible reasons as to why you're here.
Either you finished the slimGit assignment (in which case
I congratulate you!) or you're stuck in its development
(don't give up!). Anyway I'm happy that someone took
some time to work on it!

Unfortunatly there's no test script or anything like that
to verify your program. All I can offer you is my 
implementation of the slimGit project (slimGit.sh).

If you have any questions or if there's something you don't
understand and would like to, you can email me:

Thank you and happy bashing!

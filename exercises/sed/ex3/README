## Exercise 3 ##
Remember the text about whitespace characters in exercises/grep/ex2/input.txt?
On some line of that text there was whitespace characters at the end.
You'll have to create a new version of this text without whitespace
characters at the end of each line with a single sed command. Redirect
the output in a file name output.txt (use redirection ">").

## Protip: ##
The only whitespace characters contained in the test is spaces and tabs.

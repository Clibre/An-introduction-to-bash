This text is about whitespace characters. What the hell is a 
whitespace character and why is it so racist? Maybe you think
it's should be called a blackspace character. And you would be  
totally right, my friend. Indeed when your editor's background
is black, a whitespace character becomes a blackspace character.
So why don't we call it a greyspace character you will ask me?
Wouldn't it be more politically correct? Of course it would, but    
it would also, in my opinion, be really dumb. So now that the second
question is answered (why is it so racist), we will cover the first          
question. According to wikipedia, a whitespace character is a series of
characters that represent horizontal or vertical space in typography.
So basically, a whitespace characters is a character that is not visible
when rendered but still occupy an aera on the page.

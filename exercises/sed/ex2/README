## Exercise 2 ##
A "here document" is a kind of input redirection.

Syntax:
command <<AnyStringToDelimitTheInput
write anything you want
on any number of line you want
AnyStringToDelimitTheInput

Basically, every line inside the first AnyStringToDelimitTheInput and the second
one will be used as an input.

For the second exercise, you'll have to print the here document in the input.txt
file. The here document will have this form:

    cat <<EOF
...
...
...
EOF

Use a simple sed command to print the here document in a file named
output.txt (use the redirection ">")

## Protip: ##
Use the /pattern1/,/patter2/p functionality.
Don't forget to use the -n option, otherwise every line of the file will be printed.
Make sure your editor doesn't insert spaces instead of tabs.

## Exercise 1 ##
The file input.txt is a bash script. Unfortunately the function
"error" has ben declared with a spelling mistake. The programmer
wrote "eror" and repeated the error each time he called the function.
You have to fix his error with a simple sed command. Send a correct
version of the bash script in a file named output.txt (use redirection ">").

## Protip: ##
Don't forget to use the "g" option in your sed script so the change is
"global". 
Make sure you don't change words that are not a eror function
call or declaration (such as the word "emperor", for example)

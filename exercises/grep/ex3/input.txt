This essay is about the Canada Goose "Extreme wheater Outerwear".
Seriously, what is it with that brand? why is everybody in Montreal
wearing those jackets? Are they really that good? Anyway, we have to
admit that having a warm coat this winter was totally irrelevant since
the winter was very mild. I am wondering; is it real fur around the cap
or is it some kind syntetical wannabe fur? With the price of those jackets
I hope it is real fur even though I would prefer it to be fake because
I'm an animal rights supporter.

                          =========================

To whom it may concern,

This letter is for the celebration of the beautiful day that is 23/09/1993. 
This is a special day, unlike 06/03/1992, because someone special is born on this
wonderful day. Of course, it is not the birth of our lord and savior,
Richard Stallman who is born on 16/03/19653, but still, 23/09/1993 is a
day where the world kind of upgraded. Who would suspect, that this guy, who i repeat,
is born on 23/09/1993 would become a bash scripting Guru and would create the
most complete tutorial about the beautiful thing that is bash. This piece of art
that is this tutorial has been written 22 years later on the snowy day that was
03/03/2016. I think you understood that this precious individual who's birth day is
23/09/1993 is me; greg savoie. Of course, this is a joke, i am not a bash Guru
(not officially though) but I am for sure better than those who where born on
16/04/1901.

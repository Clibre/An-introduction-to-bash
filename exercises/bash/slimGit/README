This is the slimGit project. A slim, tiny, mini, micro, pocket-sized, liliputian
version control system implemented in bash.

In this project you will have to program a few basic functionality of a version
control system such as commit, checkout, log and a few more. In the file slimGit.sh
you will find a skeleton of the program.

Here is a list of the functionalities you'll have to program:

- init
- commit
- log
- ohMaGodIFuckedUp
- branch
- checkout
- merge


slimGit repository structure

projectDir/
   -.tracker
   -.slimGit/
       -projectDir-commit1
       -projectDir-commit2
       -projectDir-commitN
   -.slimGit-branchName/
       -projectDir-commit1
       -projectDir-commit2
       -projectDir-commitN
   -files...

ProjectDir/ is the directory in which you want to use the version
control system.

Files are files and directories that compose your project.

The .tracker file will be a CSV style file:
commitNumber%commitMessage%branchName%current
The current field will appear only in one record. This
field is only to know on which branch we are currently working.
Usually, the current record will the the last commited of the
branch.

The .slimGit/projectDir-commitN will contains every file/directories
that was in the projectDir directory at the moment of the commit
(except for the .tracker file and the .slimGit directory).

The .slimGit-branchName/ directories have the same structure as the
slimGit/ directory. The .slimGit directory will be called the master
branch.


Description of the functionalities


init

This command accepts no option. It will create a file named .tracker
and a directory named .slimGit. If there's already a file .tracker and
a directory .slimGit that exist, the command does nothing except to tell
the user that there's already a slimGit repository in the current directory.
It will automatically create the first commit of the repository and the commit
message will be: "initial commit"

usage:
./slimGit.sh init


commit "commit message"

SlimGit will look through .tracker and will do two things: it will
detect on which branch we are currently working (with the current field)
and it will get the latest commit number of that branch.

SlimGit will then create under the appropriate .slimGit/ directory a
directory named projectDir-commitN with N being the number fetched in
the first operation plus one.

SlimGit will then copy every file and directory of projectDir (except
for .track and all the .slimGit/ directories) under the .slimGit/
directory it just created.

The last thing slimGit will do is to edit the .tracker file. It will
remove the current field from the current record and it will add a
new record according to the .tracker file format and this new record
will now be the current one.

The message option is mandatory. If no value or an empty value is passed
an error message will be displayed and nohting will append.

Of course, slimGit will have to verify the existence of .tracker file and
at least one .slimGit/ directory. If there's none, an error message will
be displayed and nothing will append.

usage:
./slimGit.sh commit "initial commit"


log

SlimGit will, in reverse order of commit number, output every commit of the current
branch (the branch we're working on) and the commit message associated wih it.

If there's no .tracker file or no .slimGit/ directory, an error message will
be printed and nothing happen.

The log command accept no option. An error message will be displayed if
option are specified at the call of the command and nothing happen.

usage: 
./slimGit.sh log


ohMaGodIFuckedUp commitNumber

SlimGit makes sure that there's a .tracker file and at least one .slimGit/
directory. If they don't exist, slimGit output an error message.

SlimGit makes sure that there's is a commit that has the commitNumber passed
as the first argument of the command in the current branch. If no commit has
this commitNumber, an error is displayed and nothing happen.

SlimGit erase every files and directories of the projectDir directory (except for
the .tracker file and .slimGit/ directories). Note: all progress in the current
directory will be lost unless a commit has been done prior to the ohMaGodIFuckedUp
command.

SlimGit then copy every files from the appropriate .slimGit/projectDir-commitN
directory in the projectDir directory.

The last step is to move the current flag in the .tracker file.

usage:
./slimGit.sh ohMaGodIFuckedUp 32


branch branchName

SlimGit makes sure that there's a .tracker file and at least one .slimGit/
directory. If they don't exist, slimGit output an error message.

SlimGit creates a .slimGit-branchName/ directory under projectDir and copy every
files and directories (except .tracker and all the .slimGit/ directory) into the
newly created directory. If there's already a .slimGit-branchName/ an error message
is displayed and the branch is aborted.

The last step is to add a record in the .tracker file. The current flag stay
where it is since we haven't checked out the branch.

usage:
./slimGit.sh branch hotfix23


checkout branchName

SlimGit makes sure that there's a .tracker file and at least one .slimGit/
directory. If they don't exist, slimGit output an error message.

SlimGit makes sure that there's a .slimGit-branchName/ directory. If 
.slimGit-branchName/ directory doesn't exist, an error message is displayed
and the checkout is aborted

SlimGit will clear the projectDir/ directory (delete every files and 
directories except for the .tracker file and all the .slimGit/ directories).

SlimGit will then copy every files and directories in the .slimGit-branchName/projectDir-commitN
(where porjectDir-commitN is the latest commmit of that branch) directory 
in the projectDir/ directory.

The last step is to update the .tracker file and to put the current flag
on the right record. 

usage:
./slimGit.sh checkout hotfix23


merge branchName

SlimGit makes sure that there's a .tracker file and at least one .slimGit/
directory. If they don't exist, slimGit output an error message.

SlimGit makes sure that there's a .slimGit-branchName/ directory. If 
.slimGit-branchName/ directory doesn't exist, an error message is displayed
and the merge is aborted. SlimGit must also makes sure that the current
branch isnt branchName. If this is the case, an error message is displayed
and the merge is aborted.

SlimGit clears the projectDir/ directory except for the .tracker file
and the .slimGit/ directories.

SlimGet then copy the content of the .slimGit-branchName/projectDir-commitN
(where N is the latest commit of the branch) in the projectDir/ directory.

SlimGet retrieve the latest commitNumber i of the current branch and create
a new directory under .slimGit-currentBranch/projectDir-commiti+1/. A new 
record in the .tracker file must be created. 

SlimGit then delete recursively the .slimGit-branchName/ directory.

The last step is to update the .tracker file. SlimGit deletes every records
of branchName. The current flag is moved to the newly created record from the
previous step.

## Exercise 1 ##
For the second awk exercise we will use the same CSV database
that we used in the first exercise.

With a simple awk command, retrieve every records in which
the album name contains the band name. Redirect the output
to a file named output.txt (use redirection ">").

The output should formatted like this:

BandName - AlbumName (YearOfRelease)

## Protip: ##
The "~" operator in awk is for pattern matching.
ex: if(string ~ pattern) will be true if pattern2 is found
    in string.
For the format, use the printf command which uses c-like formatting.
ex: printf "%s - %s (%s)\n", string1, string2, string3

## Exercise 1 ##
In the input.txt file you will find a database containing
many of my favorite songs. The database is under CSV format
with the delimiter being "#".

A record looks like this:
Band Name#Album Name#Year of release#Song Name

Retrieve every song made by the band "Banner Pilot" with a
simple awk script and write the result in a file named
output.txt (use redirection ">")

## Protip: ##
There's two ways to do it (ok, maybe there's more..): use a filter before
your awk script (awk -Fc '/pattern/ {awk statement}') or use an if statement
in your awk script. If you decide to go with a filter; Make sure the the regex
you will use will only be matched by the first field of the record (the band name).
Otherwise, every records who has a song or an album containing the word Banner Pilot in it will be processed.

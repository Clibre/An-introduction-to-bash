## Exercise 3 ##
For the third exercise, we'll use the music database once again
but this time, there will be 2 more fields for each records: the genre
and if the song contains explicit content or not.

example of a record:
BandName#AlbumName#YearOfRelease#SongName#Genre#Explicit

If the song doesn't contain explicit content, the sixth field will be empty:
BandName#AlbumName#YearOfRelease#SongName#Genre

With a simple awk command, write every records under the format:
SongName from AlbumName, BandName «WARNING EXPLICIT CONTENT»
The warning is present only if there is six fields in the record.
In the output file, we do not want to have the records from the band
The Story So Far.
Redirect the output in a file named output.txt (use the redirection ">").

## Protip: ##
Use the NF (number of fields) buitl-in variable to know wheter or not there
is explicit content in the song.
Negate the filter with "!" operator: awk -F# '!/pattern/ {awk script}'
If you want to ignore the case in your filter, use Begin {IGNORECASE = 1}
before the filter.

# An introduction to bash

This is a short presentation on the Bourne Again Shell (bash). The bash version used in this presentation
is 4.1.2.

The presentation is divided in four distinct parts:

1. How to get by with bash (basic bash commands)
2. Customizing bash (aliases and PS1 environment variable)
3. Complex commands (grep, sed, awk, find, xargs)
4. Basic bash scripting (variables, control structures, function definition)


## What you will be after this presentation

After this presentation, you will be able to use bash for simple tasks such as copying, moving or deleting files, creating
and deleting directories, moving in your file system, etc. You will be able to manipulate text with complex commands like grep,
sed and awk. You will be able to automate simple shell tasks with shell scripts.

## What you will not be after this presentation

After this presentation, you will not be a bash master and your beard won't grow 10 inches and turn gray. Bash is a vast
subject and this presentation only adresses the surface of it.

## Just do it!

For maximal efficiency I strongly recommend you to follow this presentation in a linux environment or at least to have access
to a bash shell (via ssh, for instance).

I am a fervent believer that practice is the best way to learn. I created a couple of exercises for you so you can put to
work your newly acquired bash skills. You will find them in the exercises/ directory. **My version** of the solution to each
exercise can be found in the solutions/ directory. I insist on **My version** because there are usally multiple ways to solve
a problem and this is even more true with bash.

## Disclaimer

Last but not least, when I built this presentation, I tried to include a bit of humour in it and I just want to let you know
that I didn't mean to be offensive in any way.
